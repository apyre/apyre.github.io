Well. Finally got around to putting this new blogsite together. Neat thing about it - it's powered by Dr. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and Mr. [Github](http://github.com) I can even use Markdown to mark down my marks down on this blog page thing here. It actually is a lot easier than I read it was going to be in that tutorial I followed to make it.

**HUH** Go figure.
